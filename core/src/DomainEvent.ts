/**
 * TODOs:
 *
 * - Implement correlation IDs and causation IDs
 *    - Causation IDs allow us to determine all the events which were directly triggered as a result of something
 *    - Correlation IDs allow us to determine all the events which were indirectly triggered as a result of something
 *    - Both of these IDs could be used by clients to listen to eventually consistent data, such as when creating new views, e.g. account creation
 *    - Good source on this: https://blog.arkency.com/correlation-id-and-causation-id-in-evented-systems/
 * - Modify domain event schema, should be something like:
 *    - version
 *    - id
 *    - type
 *    - aggregateId
 *    - aggregateVersion
 *    - occurredOn/timestamp
 *    - data (event body)
